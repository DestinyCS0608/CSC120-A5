- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impression is that it's way more efficient that python where you have to import everything. It did take time getting used to especially knowing where to place certain variables and methods.

I think following the README file is the best thing to succeed in this assignment. It lays out everything for you, especially if you're not too sure where to start. I think without the README file, most people would probably start from train to work from the "outside-in" but it's actually a lot more easier to work "inside out"!
